                        only to spend it rushing from museum to restaurant to site-seeing point, cramming activities in
                        every hour of the day.<br><br>What if you could go some place and just... relax? Enjoy fresh
                        air, clean water, inexpensive food, and nature's bounty less than your daily commute away

                        It's so beautiful. Skies just like you'd expect from Montana, great food (no sales tax!), so
                        many nice places to hike, and all the peace and quiet to read a book you could ask for.

                        It's a tiny paradise. The humidity is perfect, the water taists amazing, a place to ski an
                        hour's
                        drive away, and a hot spring just up this pretty little highway. Love jumping back and forth
                        between the hot and cold pools.<br>― Tim, three-time returner.

                        It's cool because food is cheap, but really it's a driver's paradise. They have miles and miles
                        of empty, winding highway, fast speeds, gorgeous landscapes... Not a better place to be on the
                        road, whether you come on four wheels or two.<br> ― Alex, motorhead.
